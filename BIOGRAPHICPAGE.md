## Ricardo A. Fernandez

I’m Ricardo A. Fernández, a Computer Science student at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, with a passion for software engineering and a strong interest in AI and data science. I’ve had the opportunity to intern at Popular Bank, where I engineered Python scripts that streamlined treasury operations, developed a comprehensive Treasury Python Module Library, and optimized legacy systems to drive productivity. 

Currently, as a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter, I’m working on AI-based projects like a Pantry Tracker and an AI Customer Support Chat. My previous fellowship at Bloomberg gave me the chance to design a message queue system using RabbitMQ and deepen my understanding of core Python concepts. I’m always eager to learn and apply my skills to solve complex problems and make a meaningful impact.
