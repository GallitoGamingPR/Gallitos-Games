## Ricardo A. Fernandez

I’m Ricardo A. Fernández, a Computer Science student at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, with a passion for software engineering and a strong interest in AI and data science. I’ve had the opportunity to intern at Popular Bank, where I engineered Python scripts that streamlined treasury operations, developed a comprehensive Treasury Python Module Library, and optimized legacy systems to drive productivity. 

Currently, as a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter, I’m working on AI-based projects like a Pantry Tracker and an AI Customer Support Chat. My previous fellowship at Bloomberg gave me the chance to design a message queue system using RabbitMQ and deepen my understanding of core Python concepts. I’m always eager to learn and apply my skills to solve complex problems and make a meaningful impact.

## Luis E. Aviles Fernandez

Hi, I’m Luis E. Avilés Fernández. I’m a Computer Science major at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus, graduating in December 2024. My true passion lies in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics, which I’ve been able to explore through my academic journey and professional experiences.

During my internship at Eli Lilly & Company, I worked with R to analyze complex datasets, providing insights that had a real impact on the company’s projects. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that solidified my interest in data-driven decision-making.

I’ve also worked on exciting projects like developing a basketball shot tracker using YOLOv8. In addition to my professional interests, I’m passionate about video games, especially first-person shooters like Call of Duty and Overwatch. I also enjoy immersive single-player games like Elden Ring, where I appreciate the deep storytelling and complex gameplay mechanics.
